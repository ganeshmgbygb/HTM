                <ul>
                    <li>Mustafizur Rahman was bought by CSK at a price of INR 2 crore</li>
                    <li>Matheesha Pathirana picked up 19 wickets for CSK last season</li>
                    <li>Pathirana is recovering from a Grade 1 hamstring injury</li>
                    <p>Matheesha Pathirana was a tough customer to deal with as the Chennai Super League (CSK) unleashed him in the death overs in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023. Although he was a tad erratic when it came to line and length, the speedster, almost every time, put his hands up when MS Dhoni’s men needed wickets.

                        In 12 matches, the Sri Lankan pacer picked up 19 wickets as CSK went on to equal Mumbai Indians’ (MI) tally of 5 IPL titles. But ahead of the upcoming IPL season, the Super Kings have a massive headache to deal with. There are doubts over Pathirana’s participation in the tournament.</p>

              <h1>Can Mustafizur fill in Pathirana’s void?</h1>
              <p>In 16 editions of the IPL, Mustafizur remains the only overseas winner of the Emerging Player award. In 2016, the Tigers’ speedster pulled off some masterful performances and helped the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) win the title.

                In 48 IPL matches, Mustafizur has taken 47 wickets at an average of 7.93. Apart from SRH, Mustafizur also played for MI, Rajasthan Royals (RR) and the Delhi Capitals (DC).</p>
                <p>Mustafizur is known for his clever change of pace, making him tough to pick in the death overs. The pacer rolls his fingers over the ball and batters, especially right-handers, find it difficult to get him away easily.

                    The Super Kings will play their home matches at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, where the pitch is known to be on the slower side. At the Chepauk, if Mustafizur bowls at the death, he can create enough doubts in the minds of batters with his variations.
                    
                    Mustafizur recently struggled a bit when Bangladesh faced Sri Lanka in a 3-match T20I series. He picked up 2 wickets, but leaked over 40 runs in all the matches at the Sylhet Cricket International Stadium.
                    
                    But on slow tracks, Mustafizur can make the world’s best toil hard for runs. Dhoni can bring the best out of his players, and it would not be a surprise if he makes Mustafizur one of his deadly weapons in crunch moments.</p>
